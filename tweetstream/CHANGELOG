   FilterStream and deprecates TweetStream, FollowStream, LocationStream,
   TrackStream and ReconnectingTweetStream.

1.1.0

 - Fixed issues #2 and #12, related to low volume streams not yielding tweets
   until a relatively large buffer was filled. This meant that tweets would
   arrive in bunches, not immediatly.
 - Switched to HTTPS urls for streams. Twitter will switch off HTTP streams
   on 29. sept. 2011.
 - Added support for Python 3

1.1.1

 - Fixed issue #16. Odd case where python_version_tuple was returning ints
   rather than the strings the docs promis. Make sure we always cast to int.

1.2

 - Added "raw" kwarg to stream classes. Returns raw tweets rather than
   decoding the JSON.

 - New, fine grained, disconnect exceptions. Adds a ReconnectableError
   of which there are three subclases for different reconnect behaviours.
